3. Component side of the pcb is where the fri3d logo is  
- 33 Ohm (blue body and orange,orange.black colored bands) resistor on top  
- 120 Ohm (beige body and black,red,black colored bands) risistor on bottom  
2 resistors soldered

5. Electrolytic capacitor (33 microFarad)  
Mind the **polarity**: long leg is positive, short leg is negative, white marking on the body is negative  
There are 2 holes for positive and 2 holes for negative, choose best fitting ones

6. Pin header soldered on the bottom  
2 orientations are possible:
- on the bottom: this results in an upright position when mounted on the fri3d2024 badge
- at the back: this results in a front facing position when mounted on the fri3d2024 badge
